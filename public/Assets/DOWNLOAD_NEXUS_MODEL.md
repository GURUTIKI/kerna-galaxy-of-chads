## Instructions

To complete the integration, you need to download the GLB model file from Meshy.ai:

1. **Visit the model page**: [Nexus Armor Model on Meshy.ai](https://www.meshy.ai/3d-models/A-perfectly-proportioned-humanoid-figure-with-symmetrical-anatomy-and-flawless-posture-Every-movement-appears-deliberate-and-mathematically-precise-He-wears-pristine-hightech-armour-composed-of-smooth-white-ceramic-plates-fused-with-polished-silver-alloys-The-armour-has-no-visible-seams-bolts-or-damage-it-appears-grown-or-printed-as-a-single-perfect-structure-Thin-glowing-blue-energy-lines-run-along-the-armours-contours-pulsing-gently-and-evenly-The-helmet-is-sleek-and-minimal-with-a-seamless-visor-that-emits-a-soft-blue-glow-No-loose-fabric-straps-or-external-gear-are-visible-The-surface-finish-is-immaculate-slightly-reflective-and-sterile-His-presence-feels-controlled-cold-and-optimised-beyond-human-limits-v2-019b5029-a591-7f8f-910a-7cc0e64bcf2f)

2. **Download the model**:
   - Click the "Download" button
   - Select **GLB** format from the dropdown
   - Download the file (requires Meshy.ai PRO subscription)

3. **Save to your project**:
   - Rename the downloaded file to `nexus_armor.glb`
   - Move it to: `/Users/tomklitgaard/Raid galaxy of legends/Assets/`

4. **Verify the file**:
   ```bash
   ls -lh "/Users/tomklitgaard/Raid galaxy of legends/Assets/nexus_armor.glb"
   ```

## What Happens Next
